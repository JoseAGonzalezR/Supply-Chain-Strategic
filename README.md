# [Supply Chain Strategy - Product Placement)](SC_Product_Placement.pdf)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the supply chain strategy for Solid surface (Corian) product placement, aiming to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product lead times. The strategy includes transitioning key product assemblies to the Tijuana Plant, optimizing processes, and achieving significant cost savings.

## Project Scope
- **Product Lines:** ASPEKT Arm Caps, EMBOLD Arm Caps, LEELA Tables, TAVA Tables, and Benches  
- **Launch Regions:** Americas  
- **Customer Lead Time:** 5–8 weeks for finished products  
- **Processes:** Solid surface (Corian) CNC Machining, Assembly, Polish, Sanding  

## Financial Overview
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** $35,000  
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):** $15,000  
- **Payback Target:** Less than 18 months  
- **Estimated Payback:** 4.4 months  
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** 2.72  
- **Savings:** $136,272  

## Supply Chain Strategy
- **Transition to Tijuana Plant:**  
  - **ASPEKT Arm Caps:** Processed and assembled Solid surface  
  - **EMBOLD Arm Caps:** Processed and assembled Solid surface 
  - **LEELA Tables & Coffee Tables:** Solid surface with plywood processed and assembled  
  - **TAVA Tables & Benches:** Solid surface with plywood processed and assembled  
- **Rationale:** Address extended lead times, supplier unreliability, and cost inefficiencies
