# Supply Chain Strategy for Corian Product Placement

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the supply chain strategy for Corian product placement, aiming to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product lead times. The strategy includes transitioning key product assemblies to the Tijuana Plant, optimizing processes, and achieving significant cost savings.

## Project Scope
- **Product Lines:** ASPEKT Arm Caps, EMBOLD Arm Caps, LEELA Tables, TAVA Tables, and Benches  
- **Launch Regions:** Americas  
- **Customer Lead Time:** 5–8 weeks for finished products  
- **Processes:** Polish, Sanding  

## Financial Overview
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** $35,000  
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):** $15,000  
- **Payback Target:** Less than 18 months  
- **Estimated Payback:** 4.4 months  
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** 2.72  
- **Savings:** $136,272  

## Key Milestones
- **Phase 1a:** Initiation (November 20, 2019)  
- **Phase 1b:** Planning and Strategy Development (December 23, 2019)  
- **Phase 2:** Implementation  
- **Phase 3:** Evaluation and Continuous Improvement  

## Supply Chain Strategy
- **Transition to Tijuana Plant:**  
  - **ASPEKT Arm Caps:** Processed and assembled  
  - **EMBOLD Arm Caps:** Processed and assembled  
  - **LEELA Tables & Coffee Tables:** Solid surface with plywood processed and assembled  
  - **TAVA Tables & Benches:** Solid surface with plywood processed and assembled  
- **Rationale:** Address extended lead times, supplier unreliability, and cost inefficiencies  

## Value Stream Mapping
- **Current State:** Identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies  
- **Future State:** Streamlined processes with optimized workflows  

## Cost Savings Analysis
- **CapEx Breakdown:**  
  - Vertical Panel Saw Machine: $13,000  
  - Speed Random Orbital Sanders (Qty 2): $200  
  - Paint Booth Relocation: $8,000  
  - Racks & Material Handling Equipment: $200  
  - CNC Machine Servo Controller: $5,000  
  - Equipment Installation: $2,000  
  - Dust Collector: $12,000  
  - Buffer: $5,000  
  - Inspection Lights (Qty 4): $1,000  
  - Contingency: $1,000  

## Risk Assessment
- **Initial Risks:** Supply chain disruptions, equipment relocation challenges, potential production delays  
- **Health and Safety Considerations:** Ensuring a safe working environment during and after implementation  

## Conclusion
The supply chain strategy for Corian product placement successfully addresses key operational challenges by leveraging the Tijuana Plant’s capabilities. The project is designed to achieve rapid payback, substantial cost savings, and improved supply chain reliability.
